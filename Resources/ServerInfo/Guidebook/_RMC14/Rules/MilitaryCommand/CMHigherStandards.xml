  # Command and MP are held to a higher standard.
  Command and MP are held to a higher standard of play.
  - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.
  - Do not willingly and openly cooperate with terrorists/hostile forces.
  - Some leeway is given to making deals with hostile forces if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the ship as a whole and not just yourself.
  - Uphold the Law and maintain order. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior.
  - MP is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible.
  - Command are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to MP.
  - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role to do things unrelated to your role.
  - Do not abandon the ship during a raid. You are supposed to protect the ship and it's crew, not let hostile forces kill everyone on it without a fight.
  - The MP are not combat roles, and should focus solely on enforcing laws in the FOB, if granted permission to do so. See deployment rule section.
  - You are expected to be able to communicate clearly when giving orders or acting on things related to marine law, like arrest handling and appeals.
